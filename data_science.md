## what is statistics?

</span>

Collection of methods for planning experiments, obtaining data, and then organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Variable

</span>
Characteristic or attribute that can assume different values.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Random Variable

</span>
A variable whose values are determined by chance

<span style="color: orange;">

## Population

</span>

All subjects possessing a common characteristic that is being studied.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Sample

</span>

A subgroup or subset of the population.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Parameter

</span>

Characteristic or measure obtained from a population.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Statistic (not to be confused with Statistics)

</span>
Characteristic or measure obtained from a sample.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Descriptive Statistics

</span>
Collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of data.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Inferential Statistics

</span>
Generalizing from samples to populations using probabilities. Performing hypothesis testing, determining relationships between variables, and making predictions.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Qualitative Variable

</span>

Variables which assume non-numerical values.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Quantitative Variable

</span>

Variables which assume numerical values.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Discrete Variables

</span>

Variables which assume a finite or countable number of possible values. Usually obtained by counting.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Continuous Variables

</span>

Variables which assume an infinite number of possible values. Usually obtained by measurement.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Nominal Level

</span>

Level of measurement which classifies data into mutually exclusive, all inclusive categories in which no order or ranking can be imposed on the data.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Continuous Variables

</span>

Level of measurement which classifies data into categories that can be ranked. Differences between the ranks do not exist

<span style="color: orange;">

## Internal Level

</span>

Level of measurement which classifies data that can be ranked and differences are meaningful. However, there is no meaningful zero, so ratios are meaningless.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Ratio Level

</span>

Level of measurement which classifies data that can be ranked, differences are meaningful, and there is a true zero. True ratios exist between the different units of measure.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Random Sampling

</span>
Sampling in which the data is collected using chance methods or random numbers.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Systematic Sampling

</span>
Sampling in which data is obtained by selecting every kth object

<span style="color: orange;">

## Convenience Sampling

</span>
Sampling in which data is which is readily available is used.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Stratified Sampling

</span>
Sampling in which the population is divided into groups (called strata) according to some characteristic. Each of these strata is then sampled using one of the other sampling techniques.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Cluster Sampling

</span>

Sampling in which the population is divided into groups (usually geographically). Some of these groups are randomly selected, and then all of the elements in those groups are selected.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Nominal data

</span>

Nominal data is a group of non-parametric variables.For example, very hot, hot, cold, very cold, warm are all nominal data when considered individually.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Ordinal data

</span>

Ordinal data is a group of non-parametric ordered variables. In above example placed on a scale and arranged in a given order (very hot, hot, warm, cold, very cold), they are regarded as ordinal data.

Examples of nominal data include country, gender, race, hair color etc. of a group of people, while that of ordinal data includes having a position in class as “First” or “Second”. Note that the nominal data examples are nouns, with no order to them while ordinal data examples come with a level of order.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Mean

</span>

Sum of all the values divided by the number of values. This can either be a population mean (denoted by mu) or a sample mean (denoted by x bar)

- Population Mean
- Sample Mean

<span style="color: orange;">

## Median

</span>

The midpoint of the data after being ranked (sorted in ascending order). There are as many numbers below the median as above the median.
 Median is the "middle" of a sorted list of numbers.middle number in a list of numbers.

                Median Number= (n + 1)/2 

<span style="color: orange;">

## Mode

</span>

The most frequent number in data set.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Range

</span>

The difference between the highest and lowest values. Max - Min

<span style="color: orange;">

## Midrange

</span>

The mean of the highest and lowest values. 
    
                        (Max + Min) / 2

<span style="color: orange;">

## Percentile

</span>
The percent of the population which lies below that value. The data must be ranked to find percentiles.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Quartile

</span>


Either the 25th, 50th, or 75th percentiles. The 50th percentile is also called the median.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Decile

</span>

Either the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, or 90th percentiles.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Box and whisker plot

</span>
A graphical representation of the minimum value, lower hinge, median, upper hinge, and maximum. Some textbooks, and the TI-82 calculator, define the five values as the minimum, first Quartile, median, third Quartile, and maximum.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Inter-quartile (IQ)

</span>

The difference between the 3rd and 1st Quartiles.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Outlier

</span>
An extremely high or low value when compared to the rest of the values.

<span style="color: orange;">

## Standard Deviation

</span>
The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.

    sigma = The square root of the Variance.

    variance = The average of the squared differences from the Mean.
